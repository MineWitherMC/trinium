Most textures are taken from Modded Faithful Minecraft Resourcepack or derivated
from it. Those are licensed under CC-BY-NC (I was unsure about them).

Some textures are taken from BetterGregMachines Minecraft Resourcepack and
licensed under CC-BY-SA.

textures/research_bg_tier_1.png is taken from Thaumcraft and I don't know its
license. Same for textures/research_bg_tier_{2,3,4}.png, which are taken from
Electromagic Tools, Thaumcraft and Gadomancy assets respectively.

sounds/experience.ogg is taken from Minecraft assets, probably is proprietary
and is temporary.
