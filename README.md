This mod is not finished
------------------------
- Don't expect it to work as well as finished one will;
- Don't expect it to not break compatibility in next update;
- This mod is also very complex, so please report any bugs (debug.txt is
sometimes useful).

Compatibility
-------------
- Definitely works on Minetest 0.5-dev.
- *Should* work on Minetest 0.4.16.
- Incompatible with most mods because of their hardcoded recipe system.
Use it as a standalone (sub)game instead.
- Recommended: Gettext enabled for MT, you'll see dummy strings without it.
- Recommended: Minetest with commit 1e71e11, same as above if you don't use
one of supported languages (for now it's English and Russian).
